*Hello!*
This is Ramshankar, Secretary (FACE 2018-19). My co-sec Rahul and I made this Python tutorial last year for "Python Beginners" as a part of *Winter CodeX 2018*. Since we got a decent bit of reviews for our work here, I thought I might as well extend this to the first years at ASE-B this year. 
So, *hope you like it!*. 

Our contact numbers are given in the doc. So, don't hesitate to call us for any further help.

*Cheers!*

29/07/2019, 8:41 pm - Anirudh: *Hello guys!*
To be clean is to be civilised. A clean person is not the one who runs away from dirt but one who takes time and effort to tidy-up a dirty environment. So we *PRAKRITI -THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLUB* came up with a new initative called *SWATCH PATHSHALA* to keep our college clean . Let us start this with our classrooms by disposing the waste in the dustbins that is lying all around. With this small change in our attitude we can  make our surroundings better.
     Your classrooms will be checked and given points by us and your faculty . At the end of the semester on kalanjali the best class will be awarded . May be that award is yours . Get ready folks.

We've been hearing a lot about ISRO lately. 
ISRO's successful satellite missions and various other cutting edge space projects have made the organisation a national treasure. All ISRO satellite launches are associated with abbreviations like PSLV, GSLV and INSAT. Ever wondered what they mean ? Being a prospective engineer, have you ever been curious about how ISRO communicates with its satellites or how they produce such efficient rockets at relatively low costs ?

Blast from the Past🎇

A comet☄ hurtling through space finally lands on earth🌏. It explodes into pieces 💥and from its strange book arises📖 . A bird🦅 comes across this book and takes it to its nest. Months pass by and the book falls off the tree by a 🌬gust of wind. Kids wandering around come across the strange book🌟 and take it with them. This book is none other than *SPICMACAY* book.✨✨

Are you enthusiastic to have a look at that book?🤩

Its so simple. Keep in touch with whatsapp🤘bcooz

*THE FIRST EDITION  OF BOOK IS ON 14th SEP 2019 @ 8pm*

Are u confused??🤔

14/09/2020, 6:47 pm - +91 74065 01607: *IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR STUDENTS FOR AUMS TESTS/QUIZZES*
(To be shared with all students)

How can students avoid problems when taking online tests?
Online testing has more variables than the traditional classroom setting and thinking about them before test time is helpful for instructors and students. Based on our testing of the AUMS system, we offer the following guidelines to ensure students can successfully complete tests and quizzes.

Open only one window and one browser
If the quiz is open in multiple tabs, browsers, or computers, your answers may be submitted incorrectly, and the test timer may be incorrect. AUMS might also temporarily close your exam and display a ‘data discrepancy’ warning—forcing you to reopen the exam in only one window and browser. Revisiting old exams while taking an exam might also trigger these warnings and/or result in lost answers.

Save your answers frequently
If all the questions are on one page, the save button will be at the bottom of the page. Periodically click “save” and then scroll back up to answer the questions. Click only once when saving your answer. Even if the system is slow, clicking more than once could cause further delay. If it is a linear model, once you click on next your answer will be saved. 

Use a reliable network connection when possible
If the Internet connection is lost or the browser closes unexpectedly, your answers may be lost. Avoid taking tests at locations where internet access is inconsistent.

Complete the exam promptly
Open the exam only when you are ready to complete it. Do not leave the exam open while you do other things, because you could get distracted and lose your answers before they are submitted. If your instructor has created an exam with a time limit, your answers will be submitted automatically when the timer expires.

Do not use your browser's Back and Forward buttons
This can cause problems with your assessment (answers might not be saved or could be submitted automatically). If you need to move to another question, use the Previous and Next buttons at the bottom of the screen.

You may be timed out after a certain amount of inactivity
If you are working on a quiz question and there is no interaction between you and AUMS for some amount of time, you will be logged out of the system or your test will be auto-submitted. Depending on the quiz settings, you may be prevented from accessing the test or question. Timed tests begin when you start the test and launch the timer. Even if you log out, the timer continues to track the remaining time available to complete the test.

Wait for a confirmation number
After clicking “Submit for Grading,” wait for the submission screen that includes your Confirmation Number (depending on your connection, it may take several minutes).  If you close your browser before seeing this screen, your test may not be recorded.


NOTE: Certain security measures are applicable only for Tests and quizzes, you may not face the above issues with any other modules of AUMS.

16/09/2020, 5:42 pm - +91 74065 01607: *The Grand Typology of Whatsapp Users*

Over time, this uniquely evolving, almost-surreal cyber community has revealed a fairly discernible stratification, which I shall now attempt to document.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

*The Iron Curtains*
These, very iron-willed, men and women have infinite tolerance and insist on zero visibility. No amount of taunting, provocation, labeling, or even threats to remove them from the group has even the slightest effect. They continue to be unmoved and invisible – be it in a group, or otherwise.


*The Blackholes*
All your attempts at texting these blessed souls are merely one-way traffic. You will not get a reply even to “hi” or “good morning”.


*The world exists only to serve me*
These are active and frequent participants. However, a “Good Morning” or “Happy New Year” or “Happy Diwali” from you merely gets a “thank you” from them. They will not wish you back the same. It is quite clear that they have decided you do not deserve to have either a good morning or a happy new year or a happy Diwali, or a happy anything else!


*I have 100GB data per day*
These blessed souls have decided that along with Google, they need to increase our (apparently poor) knowledge by forwarding every audio, video, text message, and image they can lay their hands on. 
(Over time, I have figured out countermeasures, aimed at staying happily ignorant.)


*The Blue Moons*
They are most mysterious. They make their very rare appearances, with no identifiable cause or frequency. A rarer few are predictable, and respond to their birthday wishes from others.


*The Sunshiners*
They are truly the sunshine in our lives. They need no excuse to be cheerful and happy, and brighten every group, and every chat window with their presence, and an endless supply of smiles, or at least smileys. God bless them always!


*The Moonshiners*
They make it a point to come online only when you are in your weariest and sleepiest state. When you see their enthusiastic and cheerful text, you feel guilty but your eyelids and fading brain do not permit you to interact enough with them.


*The Greyscalers*
They, apparently, lack color vision, and see the world as a bleak, shapeless grey mass. No attempts at engaging in a cheery conversation have any effect. They seem to have an inbuilt disability to engage in smiles. 


*The Pranksters*
These age-indifferent young’uns with a seemingly endless bag of tricks have made it their life’s mission, to gain immeasurable delight, out of the short term misery and pain of their victims. 


*The Debaters*
They have a gift for provoking and inciting strong emotions with their words and swords. They make the group lively, and then make the group exhausted – not necessarily always in that order.


*The Diplomats*
They serve the most needed role of big brother big sister, arbitrator, and peacemaker. They are often, but not always, the group administrators. God bless their patience and good intentions!


*The Wits*
These precious ones, blessed with a quick mind and a glib tongue, truly hold sway over the group. While they can be scathing with their sarcasm at  times, they definitely keep us alert and alive!


_This is just a start. I invite other “researchers” to build upon this magnum opus, and freely share their findings with the world._

17/09/2020, 10:36 am - +91 74065 01607: *The Label* 

Consciously avoid labelling others and ignore labels given by others.

During a prank, a student stuck a paper on his classmate's back that said *I’m stupid* ; he asked the rest of the class not to tell the boy.

Thus the students began laughing throughout the day. Shortly afterwards, mathematics class started and their professor wrote a difficult question on the board.

No one was able to answer it except the boy with the sticker. Amid the slight laughs, for he didn’t know why, he walked towards the board and he solved it, the teacher asked the class to clap for him and removed the paper on his back.

He told him *It seems that you don’t know about the paper on your back that one of your classmates put and the rest of them kept it a secret*

Then the teacher faced towards the rest of the class and said *Before I give you a punishment, I will tell you 2 things*: 

First, throughout your life, people will put labels on your back with many bad things written on it to stop your progress.

If he had known about the paper, he would not have gotten up to answer the question.

All you have to do in life is ignore the labels people give you and use every chance you have to progress, learn and improve yourself.

“The second is that, it is clear that he does not have any loyal friends among you all to tell him about removing the paper. It does not matter how many friends you have, it is the *loyalty between you and your friends that matter*

If you don't have friends who can defend you behind your back, who can watch over you, protect you and who genuinely care about you, you are better off alone.

To the person placing the label, that word you said against the other person to one person may cause a  lifetime damage to the person.

Don't place tags on people that will destroy someone when it will not build you.

Before we dive deep into the glamorous fields of cloud and data driven technologies , here's a little insight into the basics of data representation.

Computer system and organisation deals with architecture that derives its operations based on numeric systems - binary , octal and hexadecimal.

Please tell your classmates to put headphones and settle at a place where they can fetch good network. 
(For AVP class)

18/09/2020, 10:37 am - +91 96187 95033: Hey Guys!  There's a senior who's gonna need a little help and he's working on a project that's gonna be hosted in a cloud environment, so people who are interested  and know how to work on any of these :
Mongodb, nodejs, express, html, css, js
DM me. 
(It would be much better if you have already worked on a few projects).
18/09/2020, 10:46 am - +91 90165 38357: Prohibited Processes settings for blocking specific processes and applications from running together with SEB.
    Preset prohibited processes covering communication, screen sharing and recording apps. Let us know if you would like to suggest applications and tools to be added to those preset prohibited processes (we need information about the software and its name and Bundle Identifier (if applicable).
    Added settings to allow to reconfigure SEB, even it is already running in a secure exam session.
    Implemented setting keys to control clearing cookies when starting/ending an exam session (examSessionClearCookiesOnStart / examSessionClearCookiesOnEnd). This can be used to keep users logged in from the previous session after an exam session was started (and SEB reconfigured with new settings).
    Added setting to enable Web Inspector (web developer tools) in Preferences/Browser (same settings key allowDeveloperConsole as in SEB for Windows 3.0. If enabled and right click isn't disabled (see Preferences/Security/Hooked Keys/Enable Right Mouse), you can right click/ctrl-left click on a web page element and open Web Inspector with 'Inspect Element'.
    Added Mac-specific settings for blocking screen shots and screen recording. The separate settings allow to run SEB correctly in parallel with some remote proctoring tools.
    Added separate Mac setting for the Private Clipboard feature.
    Added Mac-specific setting for blocking screen sharing over the network (VNC): key screenSharingMacEnforceBlocked (default: false, then the value of the existing key allowScreenSharing is used).
    Added all SEB for iOS settings in Preferences window.
    Fixed that a wrong Config Key was calculated because of specific new default settings added in a new SEB version. This was the cause why SEB 2.1.4 did not work correctly with the new SEB integration in Moodle 3.9.
18/09/2020, 10:46 am - +91 90165 38357: Guys how many of u are comfortable with giving complete access to ur systems?

Love and gratitude, bhakti and charity, acceptance and kindness - these are the qualities that Amma teaches us and stands for, the qualities that we strive to imbibe ourselves. 

To our beloved Amma, we wish a very very Happy Birthday and we seek her blessings and send her our respect, gratitude and love. 

This is a small tribute from the students of Amrita School of Engineering Bangalore on this auspicious day.

08/10/2020, 10:14 pm - Sukha: Sharing one message received from our Principal sir today on a group.
08/10/2020, 10:14 pm - Sukha: Normally, it is the case in every whatsapp group that a lot of members stay silent. Picture this. Suppose you walking somewhere, and you meet a friend, and looking at them you utter the words, "Good morning". Your friend simply ignores your utterance and walks away. How would you feel? Is it considered cordial? Civil? Same way, here, when some wishes "Shubhodayam/Suprabhatham/Good morning", if others don't respond, is it not like just ignoring them and walking away? I'm sure the mind will find a thousand excuses: _I was busy in the morning_, _I don't check whatsapp often_, _By the time I checked, it was afternoon/evening_, _I am not active so much in whatsapp_. These excuses are endless. First of all, there is no rule that the response should be instantaneous. Whatsapp does not impose a fine for sending a reply late. 🙊😛 There is also the aspect of "I will reply, but I will not initiate any conversation." These excuses are just different disguised manifestations of lethargy (let's not fool ourselves).😛😛

08/10/2020, 10:35 pm - +91 91130 46947: Yea, so a thousand people have to reply good morning to one person saying good morning. That's basically spamming. Not being rude or anything, but people keep this in mind and don't reply if I'm not mistaken

08/10/2020, 10:41 pm - Sukha: Well there are situations where people (including me) have not at all responded for a conversation, and probably disappointed the faculty...
Btw the good morning part was just an example to showcase the fact that there are many conversations where the teacher expects an answer from us, (this response can range from answering a question to just confirming if they are audible) and we don't deliver it. This knowingly or unknowingly lowers the morale of the faculty and at times they end up losing their interest of teaching

08/10/2020, 10:44 pm - +91 98453 95482: Nice one but where are the teachers when we ask a doubt. I get a reply after a day or so when I myself figure out the issue or a friend helps me solve it. I've seen many teachers online
08/10/2020, 10:44 pm - +91 81093 01182: I guess we should have more conversation here. And this will help in knowing our classmates better and we can form a strong group 💪

Whether it's an epic science fiction yarn or a scene from WALL-E, robots are a source of fear or joy in many different stories! Giving a digital being a sort of a personality is a great trick for humour in any story in the digital age and therefore, *ACROM-RAS* presents to you *“MUSE OVER BOTS”* where you can use your creative writing skills and muse over these robot-themed prompts and create a futuristic story with both the fun and robotic element! Mind you, the time needed is also very less! *Remember - The funnier the entries, the higher the chances of winning prices!*

*Prompts for the event are as follows: (Choose one topic)*
1)	A secret robot society came up with a diabolical plan to destroy the Sun thus destroying the whole Solar System, and you are any one of your favourite Marvel-DC character or you can be yourself, narrate a story on how you want to save the Solar System. 
2)	The year is 2450, and the world is divided. One side is for robots, the other is for humans. You were one of the unfortunate humans born on the robot side, kept alive as a slave. How will you fight technology with technology and save your kind?

23/10/2020, 6:51 pm - +91 98869 91112: Dear students,

Indulgence in a malpractice is the ignominious thing for a student. 
Unfortunately, many are doing that. 

We have marked a few malpractices during the exam and Principal sir has instructed us to award zero mark. 

If found later while evaluation then the same decision may be repeated. 

If you feel that the subject is not so core one and 'its okay' to be an indulgent or 'ye sab chalta hai' then please be forewarned that the discipline should and must be followed irrespective of the subject or situation.

I earnestly request you all to stay away from any malpractices.

-Manish Walvekar.

What are you waiting for⌚⏳?? Just bring out the Doremon in you and grab the opportunity to nominate yourself!📯 There's no voting process and all...we welcome whoever puts in their name here👇🏼
(All that you need is स्वयं-प्रेरणा (self motivation) and स्वयं-धृति (intelligence) to open⛩️ the gates of learning

With surrender, discipline and compassion we are gifted the Supreme God's grace to face all the hurdles we encounter in life. The seemingly so complicated life where we seem as mere pop ups throw us surprises as well as challenges, to face which we should be well equipped physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually!!✨✨

Rumi said:
_You are not a tiny drop in an ocean but an entire ocean in a tiny drop._

What is great in bowing down in front of god in temple or someone established in spirituality? You are truly humble when you bow down in front of every individual realising the presence of the Divine!

Again, it is not an easy thing to do!! One needs Sadhana or in simple terms practice to make progress spirituality!✨✨

It could be hard but YES! It indeed is!. This article was written by GPT-3.
GPT-3 has been created by OpenAI, a research business co-founded by Elon Musk and has been described as the most important and useful advance in AI for years.
What can GPT-3 do?🤔
GPT-3 can create anything that has a language structure – which means it can answer questions, write essays, summarize long texts, translate languages, take memos, and even create computer code.
Interesting right? Of course it is. It makes our job quite easy🤷‍♂️🤭
So want to know more about it? Then join us on 30th October 2020 for a session -Introduction to GPT-3

*~ Tony Gaskins.*

*Hello, aspiring entrepreneurs!*
All of our dreams and aspirations have come a long way. Growing up, we tend to let go of them as they might seem improbable, and we settle for less. *Most of us being a wantrepreneur* tend to fail as we are not inclined to take the plunge due to lack of motivation, resources, etc. What we overlook is that we have to stop agonizing about failures; as we ought to be right merely once. 
*The Entrepreneurship club of Amrita – ACE* is organizing a fantastic event Tomorrow, *“Wantrepreneur to entrepreneur”.*

Join to witness an insightful talk on Entrepreneurship, *to help you get started with your dreams.*

*Date  : 01-11-2020*
*Time : At 4pm*
*Day   : Sunday*

Congratulations. 
I have shared your mid-term marks in teams channel.
I am very much convinced by your mid-term performance that ‘you are best at writing descriptive answers’. Hence, I have taken a decision of conducting next quiz in descriptive form instead of MCQs. 
Prepare yourself for “Entertainment industry and Ramayana”. 
CSE A, we will conduct quiz during the class on Friday. 

All the best.

15/11/2020, 10:22 am - +91 81093 01182: Competitive Programming is quite the buzzword these days, and for a good reason. The main objective of Competitive Programming is to encourage problem-solving in a logical and mathematical way, which is an incredibly desirable skill in programmers.

Getting into it though can be intimidating, especially as a beginner. If you are struggling with how to start Competitive Coding or even if someone who has started with it but lost the way ahead, this is just what you need.

💡 The Coding Culture, an initiative by 50+ DSC across India, brings to you an online seminar on "Get it done with the experts". Get ready to know how to kick-start your journey in the world of Competitive Programming! 💡

The online seminar is going to be a panel discussion on best practices, learning resources and much more.

Mark your calendars and be ready for the biggest and the only student-run community on Competitive programming. 🔥

Namah shivaya 🙏🏻,
On the occasion of Karthika masam 2nd Monday, we all welcome you to light 9 diyas on 23/11/2020 evening and be a part of *Karthika deepochavam* 🪔.

How do I take part in this event and what should I do 🤔? Simple
 1) You should send us a picture of yours along with 9 diyas.
 2) Number of diyas  should be exactly 9 (kindly avoid using candles).
That's it. So simple right 😁.


We will be making a video  of all these pictures and post it in our instagram account on kartika poornima. You can send your pictures through the Google form.

03/12/2020, 7:13 am - +91 98869 91112: Hello, folks of CSE A and B!

As discussed with a few students, we are pleased to announce two electives for your IV Semester. You may please choose any one of them.

1.	Glimpses of Indian Polity and Economy.
This course is about understanding the current and past Indian Polity and Economy. This course deals with the basics of constitution, fundamental rights, fundamental duties, preamble, Indian polity, public administration, important cases in India and basics of Indian Economy.

This course is specifically designed for the growing young and ignited minds like you to know more about the country’s current polity.

We always encourage all Engineering students to think about the civil service examinations like IAS, IPS, IFS etc. If you look at the ratio then 60% toppers in the IAS examinations are engineers. And as an educated citizen of India, we should know about all these things irrespective of our educational background. This course will help to do a strong ground-work!

2.	The message of Bhagavadgītā.
Several students from CSE classes are having a strong inclination towards philosophy. This course is specially made for such students to satisfy their philosophical-hunger!

The Bhagavadgītā is a saga of Indian philosophy and moreover a very very very practical and rational book! This book should never be read after your 60s! This is the PERFECT time to understand and apply the book as a student of Engineering. So, ‘tension nahi lene ka!’, if you really want to cherish and enjoy the essence of the Indian wisdom then do join the course!


Apart from these two courses, we can also offer two more electives (If we get a minimum number i.e. 10 students for each elective from CSE A+B. These courses can be run, if a total of 10 students approach Mr. Manish by 02:00 PM of 03/12/2020)

1.	Introduction to Sanskrit Language and Literature
This is all about learning Sanskrit using scientific, exciting and proper tools!

2.	Indian Classics for the Twenty-First Century
A mythology-based course! Understanding the core structure of the Indian and world mythology with the help of soooooo many stories!

These courses will be taught by the faculty of Amrita Darshanam.

Looking forward to see you in the classes!

-Manish Rajan Walvekar.

Don't take too much tension.

Come out with flying colors!
❤️🌷✨⚡
03/12/2020, 8:29 pm - +91 98869 91112: I am getting so many messages from the students. 

Too much information based questions won't be asked tomorrow. 

Let me put up a few examples-

It's good to know who were the sisters of Seeta. But mugging up their birthdays is not required. 

We should know about Vishwamitra. But there is no need to memorize the name of his Aashram. 

It's advised to know and comprehend Raama's vanavaasa. But there is no point in memorizing what did he do on 789th day of his exile. 

Remember, this is Amrita 'Values' programme. We want to understand how many of you have attended the classes, contemplated on what we have taught in the classes and how many of you logged in 10 minutes before the class, muted your microphone and went to  😴😴😴😴.

All the best. 
Give your best. 
Don't tell me stories but tell me what you have understood.

Every year the footfall is around 4-5 lakhs. Industry-Academia Conclave (IAC) is an event under India International Science Festival being held between 22-25 Dec 2020. The event is going to be virtual this year.
The event has Three very interesting panel discussions consisting of eminent panellists from Industry as well as from Academia. The topics are very relevant to the present situation.
You may  depute the Prof I/c of Industry Institute Interaction Cell along with one or two faculty members from your Institution for Industry Academia Conclave. The details of the program schedule is attached. Registration is totally free and can be done at https://www.scienceindiafest.org/register/ and then selecting Industry Academia Event
Another interesting part of Industry-Academia Conclave is MEGA ONLINE Quiz Competition titled “Kaun Banega Udyogpati” for UG students of Engineering and Pharmacy. The preliminary rounds will be on 22nd & 23rd Dec and Final round will be held on 24th Dec 2020.
Quiz will be held branch wise in following disciplines
1.	Electrical                                         2. Electronics
2.	Mechanical                                      4. Civil

5.	Pharmacy                                        10.Energy (Open to all branches)
A unique thing about this quiz is that the questions for the branch wise quiz have been designed by the experienced Industry persons. It will test how much is the exposure and awareness of students about the Industry standards, practices, technical aspects, general knowledge about the branch in which he is taking the quiz as well as financial aspects.
So apart from questions from academics, the main focus will be on more practical questions.
It is requested to nominate at least 10 top UG students from your Institute from different branches to take part in this quiz.
Since the questions are being set by Industry experts and not by academicians, by undertaking the quiz, the student will know what he does not know about his branch and which he ought to know.
The total Prize money is Rs. Three lakhs seventy Five Thousand. Apart from First, Second and Third Prize of Rs. 10,000. Rs. 7500 and Rs. 5000, in EVERY branch there is a consolation prize of Rs. 500 for top 30 students in that branch. The Program schedule and Quiz Brochure are enclosed for your perusal.

18/01/2021, 11:00 am - +91 98869 91112: Rules for Faulty Comparisons   

1.  Use -er or -est for most adjectives with one or two syllables.

Wrong:  I am more lonely than she is.

Revised:  I am lonelier than she is.

2.  Use more or most for most adjectives with two or more syllables.

Wrong:  Benny is the eagerest student Ms. Johnson has.

Revised:  Benny is the most eager student Ms. Johnson has.

3.  Double comparisons occur when the degree of the modifier is changed incorrectly by adding both -er and more or -est and most.

Wrong: Doris is more friendlier than her brother.

Revised: Doris is friendlier than her brother.

4.  The misuse of the superlative occurs when a comparison is made between two things or people and the superlative form is used incorrectly.

Wrong: Of the two textbooks, the oldest edition is the best.

Revised: Of the two textbooks, the older edition is better.

5.  The superlative is also used incorrectly when it is combined with any other, meaning "only one" or with all the others, thereby excluding the compared item from its category. For example, the sentence below suggests that Montreal is the largest of one city.

Unacceptable: Montreal is the largest of any other city in Canada. (Can Montreal be the largest of one city?)

Revised: Montreal is the largest of all the cities in Canada.

6.  Illogical comparisons occur when there is an implied comparison between two things that are not actually being compared or that cannot logically be compared.

Illogical: The interest at a loan company is higher than a bank.

Revised: The interest at a loan company is higher than that at a bank.

Revised: The interest at a loan company is higher than a bank's.

7.  Ambiguous comparisons occur when elliptical words (those omitted) create for the reader more than one interpretation of the sentence.

Ambiguous: I like Nancy better than you.

Revised: I like Nancy better than I like you.

Revised: I like Nancy better than you do.

8.  Incomplete comparisons occur when the basis of the comparison (the two categories being compared) is not explicitly stated.

Incomplete: Watching television is more interesting. (Than what?)

Revised: Watching television is more interesting than reading books.

9.  Omission of other, any, and else: Do not omit the words other, any, or else when comparing one thing or person with a group of which it/he is a part.

Unacceptable: Joan writes better than any student in her class. (Joan is a student in the class. Does she write better than herself?)

Revised: Joan writes better than any other student in her class.

If the superlative is intended, use the following: Joan is the best writer in her class.

10.  Omission of as: Do not omit as when making a point of equal or superior
comparison using as . . . as.

Unacceptable: The University of West Florida is as large or larger than the University of North Florida.

Revised: The University of West Florida is as large as or larger than the University of North Florida.

Further, in such comparisons as the following, all one need do is omit the italicized phrase to see why the comparison is faulty.

Unacceptable: This is one of the best, if not the best, college in this country. (The problem is that one of the best requires the plural word colleges, not college. Such sentences need to be rewritten.)

Revised: This is one of the best colleges in this country, if not the best.

You shared the inmovidu industrial training is more of a marketing strategy too capture more students. So be careful with such things.
Also never pay for an internship. Either you get paid or don't get paid. You don't need to spend anything. Also simply doing internships or certification in 1st year doesn't make sense. You need to have some prior experience in terms of project or something. else it's not valuable.

Faculty advisors have just communicated.
 I had shared this in this group and had posted all the attachments with message in Google classroom. Students are not checking. Please inform them to check frequently all the notices.

01/02/2021, 5:00 pm - +91 98869 91112: An estimated one million Indian females suffer from PCOS every year. If not monitored in time, they can develop serious health problems. These include type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart and blood vessel problems, and uterine cancer.

We intend to educate and empower women suffering from this condition with the help of an app. Please do take this 2-minute survey to give us your valuable response and do your part in shaping a happy and healthy India.

06/02/2021, 11:04 pm - +91 90165 38357: Dear CR, Many students started asking for the bonafide certificate with reason quoting as application for passport. But when I see their performance and other activities, I don't get an impression that it is the true reason. From now onwards along with the request letter, let them provide the proof also for whatever reason they are claiming. Also, mention that if the letter contents are correct then only it will be processed. I will not help in editing their letters. Genuinely if somebody needs we can provide, otherwise they can wait.

Due to unforeseen  circumstances, the university tourneys are put on hold. But there's an online tournament conducted through fide where in our university will enroll the players for that online chess tournament. 
Currently the notice is to find if there are any fide rated players who'd just come into the college i.e., batch 20-24. So kindly interested players can ping the below contacts through WhatsApp.

*The registrations close by 9th of Feb 11:59 pm .... So hurry up register fast and be a part of the near future !!!*

Hello There!
Greetings from JIDO Club .Let's have another mind blowing seminar this year . A seminar on *"Electrification of Automobile in INDIA"* is going to be conducted by *JIDO Club*

 When?
10th February 

Guest Speaker : Karthik R (Project leader at Toyota Kirloskar Auto Parts)

Who can join?
Anyone studying in Amrita school of engineering!!😁

What are the Prerequisites required?
None...🤩


Everything is fine, but what will we learn?
On *10th* Feb:

*Electric Vehicles*
Electric vehicles have way less moving parts than your conventional-fuelled car or bike. This means there is no engine oil to be flushed, air filters to be replaced or parts to be lubed. A customary battery check-up is all that is needed.

*Hybrid Vehicles*
Hybrid are those that should consume less fuel and emit less CO2 than a comparable conventional petrol or diesel-engined vehicle. 

*Fuel Cell Vehicles*
A fuel cell vehicle is an electric vehicle that uses a fuel cell, sometimes in combination with a small battery or supercapacitor, to power its onboard electric motor. Fuel cells in vehicles generate electricity generally using oxygen from the air and compressed hydrogen.

So come let's explore the future of *Electrification of Automobile in INDIA on 10th of Feb* with us !!!🤩🤩 let's know our future!!

13/02/2021, 7:40 pm - Sukha: <Media omitted>
13/02/2021, 7:40 pm - +91 81093 01182: Python can achieve the speed of c++ when python is extremely optimized. But what if c++ too is extremely optimized?
13/02/2021, 7:41 pm - Kishan @amrita: U sit and optimize we will check then
13/02/2021, 7:41 pm - J Pravin @CSE: Don't optimize anything in java 
And it's still faster than python 🙂
13/02/2021, 7:42 pm - +91 81093 01182: Java is more like wasting time, its good in performance, but we need to code more🤦🏼‍♂️
13/02/2021, 7:43 pm - J Pravin @CSE: How is getting more performance if needed to  code more wasting time?
13/02/2021, 7:44 pm - +91 85069 00092: I thought Vivek would get triggered

13/02/2021, 7:51 pm - +91 70349 37194: Anything else is bad c++
13/02/2021, 7:51 pm - +91 6362 336 608: Does that even make sense👀
13/02/2021, 7:51 pm - +91 70349 37194: Python: development time

13/02/2021, 7:53 pm - +91 70349 37194: Well ig you don't understand it yet
13/02/2021, 7:53 pm - +91 70349 37194: There're some standards when it comes to programming in a language
13/02/2021, 7:53 pm - +91 70349 37194: It lies with the purpose with which it was intended to be used for
13/02/2021, 7:54 pm - +91 70349 37194: C++ is meant to be the most flexible in design and hence the most powerful if done right
13/02/2021, 7:55 pm - +91 70349 37194: Python's got it's moments too but that too relies on what it was intended to be used for
13/02/2021, 7:55 pm - J Pravin @CSE: Ayoo he said this sentence doesn't make sense grammatically genius 🤦🤦

As we prepare to venture the brutal and cut-throat entrepreneurial world, what we need at this critical juncture is the invaluable insight and experience of an individual who has overcome all the arduous challenges thrown at him by the unpredictable and exigent corporate world. Hence, the Xavier’s Commerce Society feels privileged to host Dr. S Jayaraman.

Dr. Jayaraman has done his graduation in mechanical engineering and post-graduation in Management from IIM Calcutta. He has done his Ph. D in the area of talent management from Aligarh Muslim University.

Register for this seminar using the following link to get an insight into the complexities of the corporate world.

Self love helps us grow through thick and thin helping us become better individuals. Let's all remind ourselves, how important we are and spread joy not only around you but to you as well. Remember, everything starts from within!

Most of you aren't listening to classes.Most of them don't know the program concepts..which are important.
Whenever explanation is done through white board, it is expected that all students note it simultaneously. Those won't be shared later.
It is requested for you to listen to class regularly and make notes for reference later.
Prepare for viva well.

If one senseless person starts a useless conversation by a gif or sticker ...a string of people join him .
It's no less than a herd...
28/04/2021, 4:53 pm - Sreeram @CSE A: Cr it's just a class group nothing personal

28/04/2021, 4:56 pm - +91 98869 91112: I never knew a class group chat would also involve stickers of Bramhanandam and other comedians.

28/04/2021, 5:02 pm - Sreeram @CSE A: It would be better if you just ask people not to do it, instead talking about common sense.... And i dont think those kinda stickers and messages offend anyone
28/04/2021, 5:04 pm - Nikhilesh @CSE: We just sent stickers for fun. If that's the mistake I can't do anything, it's already an year,we didn't have any talk or fun conversation. We didn't even know that we will even meet next sem. The rest is yours decision CR
28/04/2021, 5:05 pm - +91 98869 91112: As I said ...it's all about to stop a conversation when not necessary.
I didn't say those stickers are offensive.
I just put a message about the viva..and then most of them started sending stickers and gifs.
What if someone misses out the actuall information?
Would you take responsibility?
This isn't happening for the first time.
28/04/2021, 5:05 pm - +91 98453 95482: Hey hey calm down. Fun is different and spamming is different

28/04/2021, 5:07 pm - +91 98869 91112: If thats the case you can create another group with all classmates and send your emotions.
I'm actually serious about it.
Carry on and create a group for unofficial stuff.
28/04/2021, 5:08 pm - Sreeram @CSE A: You should have told this clearly before itself so that people won't do it
28/04/2021, 5:09 pm - +91 98869 91112: Wasn't this mentioned in first year itself?

Abhilash sir spoke to DCOE, they said that it's mostly not possible to postpone but they may allow students to write exam in the end of the month. Again this is not sure. Sir is trying from his side. 
So students who are suffering from covid or anyone in the family is suffering from covid please send your names to me with rt pcr reports so that we can get a count of it and if we have more people affected exams may get postponed.
30/04/2021, 6:52 pm - +91 6362 336 608: Guys this the responce we got when we asked our class  advisor about postponing the end sem, so I request every one of you to spread this msg .
And keep reports to your class advisor and they will surely inform u what to do next..
30/04/2021, 6:52 pm - +91 6362 336 608: It's a very serious issue out there as most of our family and friends are suffering from COVID so if u any pbm say it to the advisor they may help in any possible way.

13/05/2021, 12:29 pm - +91 98869 91112: Dear All,
 
In these difficult times it is important that we all come together like never before, and show kindness, generosity and self-sacrifice to the extent possible, and help each other in practical ways.
 
To this end I felt I should do something to bring people together – one thought is to have a support group. As a first step I created a place in Discord. I am not sure if this is the best way – but I hope that we can all learn and enhance our approach in the coming days.
 
https://discord.gg/vfqAuyfD 
 
The idea is to keep ourselves updated on those in our Amrita Bengaluru family that may be facing significant challenges and provide our support in whatever ways possible. 
 
Please feel free to spread the word and have people join (be it current students, staff, faculty, or alumni) of ASEB.
 
Take care and my best wishes for safety and good health to all!
 
Regards,
Sriram

Subject: Preparation and Selection for Microsoft Engage
 
What is the process for selection to Microsoft ? 
Well, since my selection was based on Engage 2020, I will talk about that. In that, we had to build a project, submit a few assignments and finally go through a series of interviews. I did not have an interview though and was selected solely based on my performance in the project, assignments and my mentor's review.

*How did you prepare for it ? What was your preparation strategy ?*

I did not prepare for this program specifically. I guess, having a good grasp of DSA , some prior experience with web development and a curious mind ready to learn is all it takes. 
You must be ready to study and bridge the gap for any requirements asked during the course of the project. For me, I had to delve a little into graphs for this.  

Though I didn't have one, I did prepare for interviews a little before joining this as it was internship season. Coding regularly is the only way to crack interviews, no matter how smart you are.

*Are there any resources/websites/tutorials/youtube videos that you would suggest for the preparation ?*

Nothing specific. Practice with Leetcode/ codesignal for interviews or if you are a competitive programmer, just continue the same.

If you have any doubts with basic web dev, I would suggest looking at the MDN docs. An awesome resource for web dev is 
https://css-tricks.com/

But rather than studying, I would recommend doing. And whenever you stumble across something you don't understand/know learn it

*How was the MCQ Test ? What was the difficulty level ? What are the areas of concentration ?*

For me the MCQ Test was very simple. But, it is from a pool and I know people who got some hard variants as well. The major focus was on DSA and about 90% of the questions were DSA based [Like dry runs, outputs, complexities, etc] A few questions were on basic ML. 

*How was the Coding Test ?*

I did not have a coding test  

*Any other tips from your end ?*

Well, I would say that keep doing what you do, be true to it and don't worry about the result.
You don't have to toil for hours. Prioritize your tasks. Smart work gives way better results than hard work. 

We were initially told that the assignments are not considered. In fact, we were told that the entire program was just for the sake of knowledge. Only at the end we were told about the recruitment part. Many people I know slacked off in the start and lost an easy opportunity. I was told that my work in the assignments and contribution in the project had me selected. So, I would ask you to work even when you are not watched 😜

*Also your experience with the Microsoft Mentorship Program*

It was wonderful. My mentor was actually our college alumna and she was very helpful. Being a bit on the introverted side, I had to push myself to talk, actually show my work and raise concerns. The mentors are chill people and are ready to help with everything! Just remember that they are working professionals too. So, make sure you do your research before bothering them with a query. I learnt a lot in a span of just 2 months.

A little insight about the assignments
Since the program was inclined towards artificial intelligence for us, the assignments asked us to do a little bit of research on some problems with AI. You don't have to know about any of these in advance. You will be given sufficient time and some materials to start learning about these. The assignments involved studying about a research problem and providing our insight on the same. Though Google has everything, including a paraphrasing tool, your original thoughts and insights are what matters.

I hope this is helpful. If anyone has any doubts or wishes to speak to me personally about the same, you can contact me directly.  

Regards,
Adithi Narayan

29/06/2021, 3:03 pm - +91 98869 91112: CRs- Please pass this message immediately and reply here with your branch and section once the message is posted.  

Namah Shivaaya dear students and hello!

We hope all are fine and we pray for the same. You all are in our thoughts and prayers. 

We have sent the google form links to fill up the course-end survey. The link was followed by multiple reminders. In spite of giving multiple reminders, only a handful of students have responded to the course end survey.   

Dear students, these course end surveys are very important for the college records thus they are expected to be submitted regularly. 

This is an alarming message to all those who have not reverted back to the course end surveys of the Amrita Darshanam courses. 


 *One form takes hardly 5 minutes to complete.* 

All submissions should be done latest by tomorrow (29/6/21) morning 10 AM.

We have been asked to submit a list of students who haven't responded to the survey forms for further actions.  

Considering the pandemic situation, you all are welcome and encouraged to approach your faculty if you have any issues. Please do not hesitate to approach. Feel free to ask your doubts and get them resolved. 

Take care and stay healthy. 

Thank you.

- Amrita Darshanam ICSS.

*SOMETIMES, IT IS ROCKET SCIENCE!* 
Did the Mars Rover pique your curiosity to explore further into the hidden depths of our Universe? Did you ever dream of making your own Rover?  
If yes, then here's a chance for all the space enthusiasts, robotic developers and science freaks from all branches to use their skills to gain a hands-on experience in building a Rover and to explore and experiment in fields far beyond their imagination. The main aim of this project is to compete with Rovers from across the globe in a Martian based environment at events like IRC, URC and ERC.  
All it takes is dedication and knowledge to embark on this wonderful journey of learning and innovating!

18/08/2021, 8:36 am - +91 98869 91112: Invitation for the students of Amrita School of Engineering for Bolt's All-India Innovation Challenge - 4

Greetings of the day. Previously, we invited your students to Bolt's Scholarship Program. We are overwhelmed with the number of students who answered our scholarship test. We appreciate your effort in the welfare of the students.

 

 

Based on our positive experience with Amrita School of Engineering, we are now inviting your students to participate in the fourth iteration of Bolt's Innovation Challenge. 

 

As part of this challenge, we take a few selected students from some of the prestigious colleges of India, such as Amrita School of Engineering and train them on the concepts of the IoT and ML / Web Development, which is followed by a project competition between them to choose the most innovative students from India. Please note that students from all four years of engineering are eligible to participate in the Innovation Challenge.

 

The competition will be judged by some of the experts who have worked at organizations like Amazon, Larsen & Toubro Infotech, etc. The competition will be an excellent opportunity for students to showcase their talent and skills at an All-India level.

 

 

To participate, the students will have to answer any one of the scholarship tests below:

Web Development Training Scholarship: https://info.boltiot.com/webdevelopmentscholarship
Internet of Things and Machine Learning Scholarship: https://info.boltiot.com/iotmlscholarship
 

 

What are the prizes for the students?
1st Place: Cash prize of Rs. 30,000/-

2nd Place: Cash prize of Rs. 20,000/-

3rd Place: Cash prize of Rs.10,000/-

Consolation prizes: 2 Amazon Echo Dots
 

What are the steps for Bolt's Innovation Challenge?
 

Step 1: Students will have to answer a scholarship test and qualify for the same by scoring at least 70% marks. This is a short test and will not take more than 10 minutes for the students. This ensures that they can answer it without spending much time if they have exams ongoing.

 

The selected students will be eligible to join either of Bolt's trainings at an 80% discount. We charge a small fee to cover our costs and to ensure that only interested students join the program.

 

 

To answer the scholarship, students have to visit either of the following links. They can choose to answer either of the two scholarship tests based on the training they want to take up. They could also opt for both:

Web Development Training: Scholarship link https://info.boltiot.com/webdevelopmentscholarship
Internet of Things and Machine Learning Training: Scholarship link https://info.boltiot.com/iotmlscholarship
 

Step 2: Our team of developers will train the students on the concepts of the training. Upon completion of the training, each student will be issued a certificate which can be submitted to the college/university as per the AICTE rules.

 

Step 3: The students have to build an innovative project in the area of IoT and ML or Web Development by applying the learnings of the training.

 

Step 4: The winners will be judged by engineers who have worked at prestigious organizations like Amazon, Larsen & Toubro Infotech, etc.

 

 

Why should students participate?
 

Internship opportunities: Upon training completion, students are also eligible for internship opportunities. You can get more details here: https://info.boltiot.com/internshipopportunities.
 

Certification: Upon completion of the training, the students will be issued a certificate that can be submitted to the college/university as per the AICTE rules.
 

Opportunity to build hands-on projects: As a part of the training, students will complete multiple hands-on projects, that also involve an industrial project.
 

Support to resolve queries throughout the training: In case the students are stuck at any point, we offer support via forum, email and if required, also via phone call and screen share.
 

 

Certificate for colleges and faculties:
 

Certificate for colleges: As part of this program, we will be awarding the top 3 colleges with maximum students that qualify for the final round. We will be issuing a certificate and a trophy to each of these colleges.
Certificate for faculty: A certificate of appreciation for individual faculty members who ensure 20+ applications for the Innovation Challenge from their college, for embracing remote learning, teaching and ensuring that education did not stop even during a pandemic.
Other critical points:
The option of full refund: In case the students are not happy with the training offered to them, then they can get a full refund as per the refund policy. This ensures that there is no risk for students or the faculty involved in the process. 
Lifetime access: Students can register now and start the training after the exams or at any other time.
 

Deadline to register:

The last date to avail of the scholarship and register for the Innovation Challenge is Tuesday, 24th of August 2021. Keeping this in mind, please inform your students about the scholarship and competition at the earliest.
 

Next action for faculty

We request you to forward the details of this opportunity to your students at the earliest. You may share it with them via Email, Notice Board, WhatsApp, and other channels as well. 

 

You can share the link directly on WhatsApp from here: https://info.boltiot.com/iotmlinnovationshare

 

 

We look forward to training the students of 'Amrita School of Engineering' on the concepts of the training as well as their participation in the competition.

18/08/2021, 10:48 pm - +91 98869 91112: SOME SOCIAL RULES THAT MAY HELP YOU:

1. Don’t call someone more than twice continuously. If they don’t pick up your call, presume they have something important to attend to;

2. Return money that you have borrowed even before the person that borrowed you remember or ask for it. It shows your integrity and character. Same goes with umbrellas, pens and lunch boxes.

3. Never order the expensive dish on the menu when someone is giving you a lunch/dinner.

4. Don’t ask awkward questions like ‘Oh so you aren’t married yet?’ Or ‘Don’t you have kids’ or ‘Why didn’t you buy a house?’ Or why don't you buy a car? For God’s sake it isn’t your problem;

5. Always open the door for the person coming behind you. It doesn’t matter if it is a guy or a girl, senior or junior. You don’t grow small by treating someone well in public;

6. If you take a taxi with a friend and he/she pays now, try paying next time;

7. Respect different shades of opinions. Remember what's 6 to you will appear 9 to someone facing you. Besides, second opinion is good for an alternative;

8. Never interrupt people talking. Allow them to pour it out. As they say, hear them all and filter them all;

9. If you tease someone, and they don’t seem to enjoy it, stop it and never do it again. It encourages one to do more and it shows how appreciative you're;

10. Say “thank you” when someone is helping you.

11. Praise publicly. Criticize privately;

12. There’s almost never a reason to comment on someone’s weight. Just say, “You look fantastic.” If they want to talk about losing weight, they will;

13. When someone shows you a photo on their phone, don’t swipe left or right. You never know what’s next;

 14. If a colleague tells you they have a doctors' appointment, don’t ask what it’s for, just say "I hope you’re okay". Don’t put them in the uncomfortable position of having to tell you their personal illness. If they want you to know, they'll do so without your inquisitiveness;

15. Treat the cleaner with the same respect as the CEO. Nobody is impressed at how rude you can treat someone below you but people will notice if you treat them with respect;

16. If a person is speaking directly to you, staring at your phone is rude;

17. Never give advice until you’re asked;

18. When meeting someone after a long time, unless they want to talk about it, don’t ask them their age and salary;

19. Mind your business unless anything involves you directly - just stay out of it;

20. Remove your sunglasses if you are talking to anyone in the street. It is a sign of respect. Moreso, eye contact is as important as your speech; and

21. Never talk about your riches in the midst of the poor. Similarly, don't talk about your children in the midst of the barren.

22.After reading a good message try to say       "Thanks for the message".

APPRECIATION remains the easiest way of getting what you don't have....

GEHC has gathered problems to be solved and innovative ideas to be implemented, with special focus on digital technology enablement for businesses.

Duration of these project will be 8 weeks. Students can execute these and collaborate with mentor(s) remotely.

College leadership can pick the students themselves. Pick students with strong technical expertise, interest and ability to learn and commitment to bring results.

The value this adds to students and colleges  is the exposure to actual industry problems and experience in working in industrial team to solve those.

There will be rewards and recognitions for projects well executed. All teams will be receiving the participation certificates. Top projects will be demonstrated to wider audience in GE as part of culminating events of HACK-E-LTH. There will be attractive prizes.

🎨🌈
Art is not a technical skill, not one that can be aped, yet it can be a path to self discovery. It's not a thing to judge or measure by imaginary yard-sticks. It is the seeds of our minds that grow and help us navigate our way toward happiness and health. Pain may come out in a painting, or the toll on our being be told in a story, dancing and weaving in the metaphors of life. 
🍃
If you're someone who's passionate about any form of art, come join us and pave a path for yourself to learn and explore new things everyday! We, at Kala ASE-B, hereby announce the forum open for executives! ✨

*Application Link* - https://forms.gle/6x5kqoMdaYqshah97
 
*The Perks Of Being An Executive* 🖊️
🌼 Get a chance to learn new techniques of art through the community members. 
🌼 Get exclusive contests drafted out for you by the club leads from time to time. 
🌼 Engage with like-minded artists in the campus and explore possibilities of collaboration.
🌼 Learn essential skills like team management and interpersonal/intrapersonal communication. 

We'll be waiting in the wings to see you guys as a part of the club! All the best! 😇🌸

💫We, at ACE, the Entrepreneurship Club assist you through the task of achieving those dreams. Sure, it'll be a hustle, but it's all worth it for the castle that you'd build.

What is quizzing?

It is not about "Who is the captain of the first ship that entered India and the name of the ship".

It is about daily life facts and information that is common, and the questions which make us explore from all possible angles to arrive at an answer.

It is also about high competitiveness between the teams and 
the team which hits the buzzer first!

Doesn't it sound exciting!!
Come join us at *The Quiz Club* to have a fascinating experience about quizzing. Grab this opportunity to be a part of the quizzing family and let's have fun quizzing!!

🎨🌈
Art is not a technical skill, not one that can be aped, yet it can be a path to self discovery. It's not a thing to judge or measure by imaginary yard-sticks. It is the seeds of our minds that grow and help us navigate our way toward happiness and health. Pain may come out in a painting, or the toll on our being be told in a story, dancing and weaving in the metaphors of life. 
🍃
If you're someone who's passionate about any form of art, come join us and pave a path for yourself to learn and explore new things everyday! We, at Kala ASE-B, hereby announce the forum open for executives! ✨

As fans, we're important! Aren't we? 😎 Do you remember, when lockdown got us watching our favourite teams battling it out to claim the title of the season and fans made this game so popular that it's always at par with football when it comes to #justfanthings 🤩

Here we are, organizing the most awaited debate of the year- *Which team is going to win the IPL, 2021?* 
Bring in all the energy you've got and cheer up your favourite team! Gear up for this war of words! 

The Great IPL Debate 🔥-

Greetings of the day…

A Cyber Security Hackathon is being conducted for the Indian Army by Military College of Telecommunication Engineering, Mhow and Rashtriya Raksha University with ISAC as the Knowledge Partner.

The Hackathon is extended over three months and commenced on1st October this year. The participation is open to engineering students across the country as also to Army personnel. It is expected that 100000 people will participate in this individual participation event in an online mode.

Conducted over three stages, the levels of difficulty will keep increasing through each stage. The final level will also see participants competing with each other in the fields of secure coding and exploitation of software defined radios (SDRs) and will culminate in individuals competing with each other in cyber space with real and simulated threats. The participants will need to devise and execute their strategy to beat others to Capture the Flag.

The event will also host a number of seminars, expert talks and conclaves, to focus on emerging cyber threats in the military domain and the methods of mitigation.

Rashtriya Raksha University, an Institution of National Importance under the Ministry of Home Affairs is executing the Hackathon with its knowledge partners ISAC.

There is a dedicated web portal www.sainya-ranakshetram.in which allows registration and also tracks the conduct of the event. The Indian Event Army is planning to have this as an annual event.

This event is expected to benefit a large number of students to gain experience and get an opportunity to win over INR15,00,000 as prize money.

We hope your institution will take maximum advantage of this event.

For any other clarifications, feel free to contact pan@isacindia.org and rajsm@isacindia.org .

AMRITA University in partnership with Deakin University, Australia is organizing an ONLINE Web based Workshop titled “Industry-University partnerships for SDG focused Internships in Australia and India”, on Thursday, November 11, 2021, from AMRITA University, Bangalore Campus. 
 

The workshop has multiple internships and job opportunities in India and Australia for BTech and MTech Students. They just need to attend the Panel Discussion for 1 hour. 



I truly appreciate if you could request the BTech Final and 3rd Year CSE and MTech CSE, DataScience and Embeeded to attend, it will benefit them.

 
The main objective is to "promote exchange and collaboration between Australian and Indian organizations in fields of relevance to the bilateral economic partnership". The project is supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and is aligned with the Australia India Council’s (AIC). 

 

It will be a great value add for all the participants. 

 

Truly appreciate your support.

09/11/2021, 6:37 pm - +91 85069 00092: Nah, they just looking for people to arrange the stuff for them from the looks of it
09/11/2021, 6:38 pm - +91 90165 38357: Atleast they are not gonna hire people without proper interviews 😂
09/11/2021, 6:39 pm - +91 85069 00092: That's there lmao
09/11/2021, 6:43 pm - +91 90165 38357: This club also looks crappy from their form
09/11/2021, 9:41 pm - Sukha: Appreciate their efforts buddy
Atleast they are trying to do something as much as they can, unlike some clubs which haven't even conducted their inaugural event... And have left it to their parental forums to deal with the pressure put by the teachers 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
09/11/2021, 9:44 pm - +91 98869 91112: No *CN* class tomorrow.

09/11/2021, 10:04 pm - Sukha: The attendance was a part of the teachers who had given their classes for conducting the event
It has no relation with the club
09/11/2021, 10:05 pm - +91 6362 336 608: Indirectly it did🤷‍♂️
09/11/2021, 10:05 pm - +91 85069 00092: Yeah ofc that only happens for that specific club doesn't it, other clubs have to stick with conducting their events whe classes aren't there or spoil people's weekends
09/11/2021, 10:06 pm - Sukha: You have to ask teachers
If you don't ... It won't come and fall into your hands 🤷🏻‍♂️
09/11/2021, 10:07 pm - +91 85069 00092: Oh wow, why didn't we think of that 🤔
09/11/2021, 10:48 pm - +91 90165 38357: Atleast the other clubs don't hire ppl without interviews(refrence: entrepreneurship club hired a mech guy without any interview)

Do you still want to spend your time chasing 1 million likes on Insta and FB? Do you still want to spend your time with Korean drama and bands? Do you still think humor means memes derogating people around you? After you watch the video, think - do you want to be just one among a herd of cattle?

17/12/2021, 9:34 pm - +91 90165 38357: We find similar questions on AUMS. Before I read the malpractice warning, please check your pockets for mobile phones, notes or paper. If you are found to have a mobile phone in your possession once the examination has commenced, I must report you to NESA, and you may be penalised, which may result in being given zero for the examination, or not qualifying for the HSC. Raise your hand if you have a mobile phone or any other unauthorised material.

I will now read the malpractice warning: The NSW Education Standards Authority rules state than any student found with notes, paper, unauthorised material or any communication device such as a programmable watch, smartwatch or a mobile telephone in the examination room may have a penalty imposed, such as zero for this examination or no result for the course. If you have accidentally brought into the examination room anything with notes on it, paper or other unauthorised material or equipment, please place them in the designated area before this examination starts. There will be no penalty if they are handed in now. They will be returned to you when the session has finished. You must complete the student completion record, and ensure it has been checked and signed by the supervisor, before you leave the examination room. If you leave before this happens, your presentation for the examination may be treated as a breach of examination rules.

17/12/2021, 9:38 pm - +91 90165 38357: Let me tell you the truth about Santa Claus. If his Marx-esque appearance and red clothing weren’t an immediate giveaway, I must point blank tell you: Santa is a communist.

I am sorry if I ruin your festive mood, I am sorry if you think it’s blasphemy, but it’s time to face the facts. Despite of what you want to believe, the world is governed by market forces and a seemingly benevolent, egalitarian creature won’t grant your wishes just because you ask nicely. So before you go wasting ink and paper writing your letter, hear me out.

Santa Is an Authoritarian
First of all, sorry to shatter your beliefs, but Santa is not benevolent. He is an authoritarian who without any rule of law arbitrarily decides who is naughty or nice. If he deems you nice, he will reward you. But if he deems you naughty, well, who knows what a powerful communist like him would do to you.

Sure, you could argue that the nicer you are, the bigger the reward, but that’s also true for a communist dictator. The closer you are to his own subjective ideal, the better you serve his own interests, the more you will get. There is no telling, however, when his fancy changes.

Santa won’t reward you on some objective merit. He favors his cronies, but he thinks everyone should get something. Each according to one’s needs.

In the spirit of a good egalitarian tradition, he disincentivizes actual accomplishments. If you keep your head low you will get something. It is unnecessary to do better. Only if you are a crony, is it worth to aim higher.

If you are not deemed as an enemy of Santa, you will receive something, don’t worry.

Moreover, where do you think all those toys come from? Santa is running a sweatshop exploiting the elves, who won’t get any wagers. They are essentially slaves, who have to work, because they fear Santa. It only makes sense. Santa doesn’t ask for money for what he is doing, so he himself has no income. This means he cannot pay any employees.

And what exactly is Santa doing? He knows where you live,he know what you have been doing, he spies on you, disrespecting your privacy. Santa goes into your house, disregarding private property, and forces his services on you.

In turn, as a sort of tax, he takes your milk and cookies. Will he at least give some of that to the elves? I hardly think so. He wouldn’t want to incentivize slaves, now would he?

Santa: The Embodiment of the Communist Utopia
One word. All it takes is one word to show you why Santa is a communist: scarcity. The bane of all communist utopias, scarcity gives goods their value. 

Santa, however, has an infinite amount of time and resources. How else could he deliver all the toys in one night, and be able to manufacture them every single year? The toys he gives are therefore worthless. Not only are they not the rewards for actual actions, as I pointed out before, but because of the lack of scarcity they don’t have value.

Ever wondered why Santa is not giving out money, only toys? It’s because if he lifted scarcity of money, it would become worthless too. This is another reason he won’t pay his elves. It would cause an inflation, which would eventually destroy the currency.

This is, therefore, the limit of Santa’s power and the barrier in front of all communist utopias.

We don’t have an infinite amount of everything. It is not a problem though. Scarcity creates value and incentives. It creates respect for things. It creates economics, rule of law, and social order. And it creates a demand for free markets, to transfer the scarce goods. This is what Santa would never fully understand.

The only thing that gives Santa the ability to eliminate scarcity, to exploit his slave elves, to force his services upon you, and break into your home, taking your milk and cookies, the only thing that gives him the power to arbitrarily judge you is your misguided belief in the communist utopia that is Santa.

So stop believing in Santa. Stop believing in a higher, seemingly benevolent force that you think will provide without you lifting a finger. It is time to wake up.

The world is a wonderful place, and Christmas is a truly touching time of the year regardless of your religious persuasions. But not because of Santa. It is because of you. It is you who govern your own fate. It is you who help people on your own merit.

Whether you work or you provide employment, whether you donate or help out, it is you who are constantly making the world a better place. You don’t need a communist Santa, you don’t need a communist utopia. This is reality.

Stop believing in communism and start working for the benefit of free market.

18/12/2021, 5:25 pm - +91 90165 38357: had a problem with me laughing at the stupid questions, and accussed me of talking to ppl, like wtf? Cant even laugh at the stupid questions anymore? Before I begin my actual comment, I would like to apologize in advance for my inadequate level of English proficiency. I am not a native speaker of the world's current lingua franca which unfortunately leads to me making numerous embarrassing mistakes being made whenever I attempt to communicate using this language. Whenever I am reminded of how I lack the ability to convey my thoughts in an eloquent manner I feel as though I have committed a cardinal sin, as though every English teacher in the world are simultaneously shaking their heads and sighing due to how utterly disappointed they are at me.

Although I know that saying sorry to those of you who are reading my comment will not change the fact that I fail miserably to write and speak perfect English, I am writing this as a way to deter a certain type of people who cannot stand poor English (Also known informally as "Grammar Nazis") from mocking me by posting unwanted and unnecessary comments detailing my every blunder. In my humble opinion, making grammatical errors should be perfectly acceptable as native speakers should not expect non-native speakers to be able to communicate in their second or third languages eloquently. If you are able to completely understand what the other person wrote, is there really a problem with what they've written? No, because the entire concept of communication is the exchange of information between other intelligent beings, which means that no matter how the exchange of information is made, as long as the information is accurately shared there is not a fundamental issue with their ability to communicate. To see it in another way, remember that someone who isn't fluent in English is fluent in another language. When you think about it this way, isn't it impressive for someone to speak a second language in any capacity? Having empathy and respect are qualities that are sorely missing for far too many people these days, especially on the internet.

That being said, I am aware that not all netizens who correct others are doing it to ridicule and shame. There are some who do so with the intent to help others improve and grow. However, displaying the failures of other people publicly will cause the person who is criticized to feel negative emotions such as shame and sadness due to the fact that their mistake has been made obvious which severely undermines the point they were trying to make in spite of their unfamiliarity with the English language. In most circumstances people are not looking for language help when they post anything online. Most people just want to enjoy themselves and have a good time on the internet which is why I would not encourage correcting other people regardless of your intentions. If you really do want to help others with their spelling or grammar, I would highly recommend you to help via messaging privately because not only will you not embarrass anyone, you can also go more in-depth with your explanation which I'm sure the other person will greatly appreciate if they want help, but I digress. I know that I've written a bit of an essay, but I hope I've made my points clear. Anyways, here is the comment I wanted to make:

Our invig. was effed up man.

even when the aim is to investigate causality. For example, suppose you want to study the
effects of alcohol consumption during pregnancy, and you randomly assign some pregnant
women to your “alcohol” group. You should not expect cooperation from them if you present
them with a drink. In such situations you will almost invariably be conducting an
observational study, not an experiment. Be alert for confounding factors."

12/01/2022, 7:11 pm - +91 98869 91112: Amrita University has recently established an Honorary Doctorate degree initiative, to honor the world’s leading scientists, academics, and public servants, for their contributions to humanity.
*The Honorary Doctorate ceremony will be held virtually on January 12th, 2022 from 8:15 pm to 10:00 pm IST.*
Join via Zoom. Visit amrita.link/honoraryphd

We are very pleased to inform you that Jeffrey D. Sachs, Global Economist for Sustainable Development, and Kailash Satyarthi, Nobel Peace Prize recipient, will be awarded Honorary Doctorates in the first event of its kind at Amrita University.

Jeffrey D. Sachs is a world leader in the field of Sustainable Development and has been instrumental in helping such a field get recognition through his tireless work around the world. He spearheaded its formation and spread in the academic world by creating a multi-disciplinary and multi-level view of what was then a new area. In addition, his broad and deep knowledge of economics and allied fields allowed him to convince the United Nations and major international NGOs to join the effort to make our world a better place for future generations of the world’s children.

Nobel Peace Laureate Kailash Satyarthi is widely known across the globe for his tireless efforts on child protection. He has been at the forefront of the global movement to end child slavery and exploitation since 1980. Through his “Save Childhood Movement” (Bachpan Bachao Andolan), he liberated more than 86,000 children in India from child labor, slavery, and trafficking. He developed a successful model for their education, rehabilitation, and reintegration into mainstream society. His mission to create a child-friendly world resulted in hundreds of “child-friendly villages” or Bal Mitra Grams (BMGs) in India and Nepal.

20/01/2022, 10:58 am - +91 98869 91112: Dear ALL,

InfyTQ is a challenging Certification more so for the non CSE students. As a faculty who was involved in teaching InfyTQ Python Fundamentals I know that you must prepare seriously if you aim to clear it. InfyTQ Exam is usually in the last week of February. You have to prepare on all the 4 modules of which Python and RDBMS will have more weightage. You have practice as there is a time limit for the questions. The Qualifier round is MCQ based but the final has both MCQ & Coding Questions. You have to score over 65% to 
clear it.

The 4 modules of InfyTQ are :

Python Fundamentals (or) Java Fundamentals
OOP using Python or Java
DSA using Python or Java
RDBMS

Please find attached PPT on details about InfyTQ Certification. 

Here are some links to InfyTQ Class Lectures

Greetings and our Best wishes for the New Year 2022.

The International Day of Commemoration in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust as designated by the UN General Assembly is held annually on 27 January – As such, it would be commemorated by the Consulate General of Israel in Bengaluru.

The day of anniversary was chosen as it marks the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp, in which the International community joins in memory of the victims of the Holocaust.

The Holocaust was a turning point in history, which prompted the world to say "never again". The significance of respected UNGA resolution is that it calls for a remembrance of past crimes with an eye towards preventing them in the future.

Due to the Covid-19 situation, the ceremony will be held Virtually and take place on January 27th, 5:30pm-6:00pm.

Kindly find below the registration link for attendees.

30/01/2022, 12:36 pm - +91 81093 01182: Networking is not collecting contacts! 
Networking is about planting relations. 

Build a relationship with people you do serious business with. One can escape a deal but not a relation.
However, we don't often get an explanation on why it is important. 

*_Your network is your net worth_*

When you use it correctly and with panache, LinkedIn can perform near miracles for your development and entrepreneurship journey. It's built on the simple but effective premise of professional networking, making it the perfect place to reach professionals of all ages and backgrounds all over the world.

Join us on this venture on *3rd February from 5:00pm to 6:00pm* to understand how you can optimize your profile and make the best use of it in your entrepreneurial journey!

I understand that few might be missing due to medical reason or any other genuine reason. Attendance is taken everyday for all the classes thru teams. If the students are not satisfying the minimum attendance criteria, you may end up with FA grade. This message can be treated as a strong warning to take care of the attendance too. It becomes individual student's responsibility to satisfy all the required criteria for completing the course.

On behalf of FACE and ACM, we would love to welcome you all to an *interesting talk by Mr. Aditya Nandakumar, Principal Consultant, Ramco Systems,* on the topic of *“Commendable recommendation across web-platforms - the science behind the intuition”* which shall explore the working behind recommendation engines in web platforms, a very consistent and popular example of machine learning in today’s world.
 In this seminar, Mr Nandakumar shall not only take us through the computer science concepts but also through the mathematical and physical intricacies that exist behind the creation and implementation of a recommendation engines. 
We are sure that under the guidance of Mr Nandakumar, who is a graduate of IIT Madras and is also pursuing an Advanced Management Program in Business Analytics degree from ISB Hyderabad, with a decade of work experience across multiple sectors such as KPMG management consulting, Adani Group, IPAC political consulting, etc. and who has also offered tons of  lectures, webinars, and workshops on multiple topics including Data science, Python, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Statistics and their practical applications in day-to-day life, all the attendees shall have a diverse and enriching exposure to the fields of AI, Recommendation-based algorithms, and Machine Learning, which are of paramount importance to the engineering students of the future.
